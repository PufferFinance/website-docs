### Our Vision
At Puffer, we envision a decentralized financial ecosystem that empowers users, fosters innovation, and upholds Ethereum's core principles. Puffer has always striven to preserve what we believe to be Ethereum's most important value - decentralization. This is why our ecosystem has been about fostering permissionless validator operations.

To embody these principles of decentralization within our own protocol, we're transitioning to a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO). This move ensures that the future of Puffer is shaped not by a centralized authority, but by our community of token holders and ecosystem participants. Through the DAO, we're not just advocating for decentralization â€“ we're living it, allowing our governance to reflect the very values we seek to promote in the broader Ethereum ecosystem.

### Our Ecosystem
The Puffer ecosystem now encompasses:

- [Puffer LRT](https://www.puffer.fi/restake): Our flagship Liquid Restaking Protocol
- [Puffer UniFi](https://unifi.puffer.fi/): Our Based Rollup stack 
- [UniFi AVS](https://docs.puffer.fi/unifi-avs-intro/): The first-of-its-kind preconf service for based rollup preconfirmations

### Our Commitment
Throughout our growth, we remain steadfast in our commitment to building Puffer into a:

- Trustless protocol
- Decentralized infrastructure
- Community-governed ecosystem

### The Puffer Foundation
To ensure our growth aligns with our community's vision, we established the Puffer Foundation. Its mandate is to:

- Provide initial guidance
- Facilitate transparent governance
- Support the transition to full community control

### Community Governance
The [PUFFER token](./governance-token.md) is the cornerstone of our governance model, empowering our community to:

- Participate in key decisions
- Shape the future of the Puffer ecosystem
- Uphold Ethereum's core principles in all our endeavors

### Inclusive Participation
We believe in the power of diverse perspectives. Therefore:

- We invite everyone interested in Puffer's mission to join the conversation and contribute ideas.
- While voting rights are reserved for PUFFER token holders who have locked their tokens in our voting escrow token vePUFFER, we value input from our entire community.
- Your voice matters in shaping our protocol and contributing to the broader Ethereum ecosystem, regardless of token ownership.

Together, we're not just building protocols; we're shaping the future of decentralized finance on Ethereum.
