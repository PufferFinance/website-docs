The pufETH LST accrues Proof of Stake rewards and restaking rewards through Eigenlayer.

### Liquid Staking Token
pufETH is the ERC20 token that stakers get as a receipt when they stake ETH in Puffer. It is a reward-b  token follows the yield-bearing model It follows the 

reward-bearing token akin to [Compound's cToken](https://docs.compound.finance/v2/ctokens/#ctokens), which is optimal regarding DeFi compatibility. 


As the protocol generates restaking rewards, the amount of ETH backing pufETH increases, increasing the conversion rate between the two. Holding liquid pufETH allows one to earn restaking rewards over time while still being able to participate in DeFi.


**Puffer Rewards** 
> Puffers deposit ETH at the PufferPool contract to mint pufETH. At the protocol's inception, the conversion rate would be one-to-one, but assuming the protocol performs well, i.e., accrues more rewards than penalties, the conversion rate would value pufETH higher than ETH. Thus Puffers holding pufETH can expect its value to increase over time.
o
- **Liquid Staking Token**: The pufETH LST gains value over time as NoOps join the protocol via the smoothing commitments payments, and from earned restaking rewards. The stakers that hold pufETH reap higher rewards compared to traditional LSTs due to the inclusion of restaking rewards.
