:::info About UniFi AVS
UniFi AVS is an EigenLayer-based solution addressing challenges in Ethereum's preconfirmation (preconf) ecosystem. It offers permissionless validator participation, an on-chain registry, and slashing mechanisms for accountability.

Built on EigenLayer and integrating [Commit-Boost](https://commit-boost.github.io/commit-boost-client/architecture/overview), UniFi AVS aims to provide fast, secure, and neutral preconfirmations for based rollups, enhancing Ethereum's scalability while maintaining its core principles of decentralization and security.

## What does UniFi AVS bring? 🚀

### **Protocol Features**

- 🟢 Permissionless: Any restaked validator on EigenLayer can participate.
- 📊 On-Chain Registry: Transparent and discoverable preconfer registry.
- ⚖️ Slashing Mechanism: Enforces accountability for preconfirmation promises.
- 🔗 EigenLayer Integration: Leverages restaking for capital efficiency.
- 🌟 Innovation Catalyst: Enables rapid innovation without altering Ethereum's core protocol.

### **Preconfirmation Service**

- ⚡ Fast Confirmations: Near-instant transaction confirmations (~100ms).
- 🔒 Security: Strong assurances from Ethereum validators, backed by economic security.
- 🌐 Neutrality: Commitment to impartiality and unbiased operation.
- 💪 Binding Promises: Unlike centralized sequencers, preconfirmations are backed by real economic consequences.

### **Makes Based Rollups Viable**

- 🔄 Liveness Guarantees: Inherit robust liveness from Ethereum L1.
- 🛡️ Simplicity and Security: Leverage Ethereum's existing infrastructure.
- 💰 Economic Alignment: MEV flows back to Ethereum L1.
- 🤝 Synchronous Composability: Interact across different based rollups.
- ⚡ Enhanced Speed: Overcome the limitation of long L1 block times.

### **Commit-Boost**

- 🌟 Open Source: Developed as a public good.
- 🔧 Standardization: Facilitates easier integration with validator software.

</div>

UniFi AVS creates a robust ecosystem that enhances Ethereum's capabilities without compromising its core principles. It brings together validators, users, and the broader Ethereum community to provide faster, more secure, and more efficient transaction processing.

The ecosystem is driven by **Validators** and **Users**:

- **Validators** can participate in UniFi AVS by owning an EigenPod and running Commit-Boost software. They provide preconfirmation services and earn additional rewards while contributing to the network's security and efficiency.

- **Users** benefit from near-instant transaction confirmations (~100ms) for both L1 transactions and based rollup transactions. This significantly improves the user experience, making it comparable to or better than alternative L1 blockchains.

### Why be a Validator on UniFi AVS? 🤖

Validators can leverage their existing restaked ETH to participate in UniFi AVS, offering several benefits:

- 💰 Additional Rewards: Earn extra rewards by providing preconfirmation services.
- 🔒 Capital Efficiency: Use restaked ETH as preconf collateral without additional deposits.
- 🌐 Network Contribution: Play a crucial role in enhancing Ethereum's transaction speed and user experience.
- 🚀 Innovation Participation: Be part of cutting-edge advancements in the Ethereum ecosystem.
