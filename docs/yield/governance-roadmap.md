# Puffer Governance Roadmap

Our transition to full community governance will occur in stages, ensuring a smooth, secure, and effective implementation. Note that the roadmap and timeline are subject to change as the protocol evolves.

Throughout all phases, we remain committed to:

- Fostering broad community participation in discussions and decision-making
- Maintaining transparency in all governance processes
- Balancing innovation with security and stability
- Upholding Ethereum's core principles of decentralization and permissionlessness

## Phase 0: Initial Allocation and Off-Chain Voting

- Launch of the PUFFER token
- Introduction of vePUFFER minting
  - Users can immediately lock their PUFFER tokens to mint vePUFFER NFT
  - This action initiates the accrual of voting power necessary for future governance participation
- Opening of the [governance forum](https://governance.puffer.fi) for community discussions
- Implementation of [off-chain voting mechanisms](https://vote.puffer.fi) for initial community input
- Launch initial proposals for whitelisting AVSs

## Phase 1: vePUFFER Utility Expansion

- Full implementation of the vePUFFER model in collaboration with Aragon
- Enhanced utility for vePUFFER holders:
  - Boosted voting power based on lock duration
  - Gauges for AVS allocations
  - Potential for additional protocol rewards or benefits
- Launch initial incentive gauges
- Rollout initial governance processes
- Refinement of governance mechanisms based on community feedback
- Exploration of cross-protocol governance opportunities within the UniFi ecosystem

## Phase 1.5: Change to vlPUFFER

- Change voting token from vePUFFER to vlPUFFER
- vlPUFFER uses a different model from vePUFFER, where users lock $PUFFER tokens to receive vlPUFFER voting power based on a multiplier system ([vlPUFFER documentation](./governance-token.md#vlpuffer))
- New voting page, divided into [Proposals](https://app.puffer.fi/proposals) and [Gauges](https://app.puffer.fi/gauges) sections

## Phase 2: On-Chain Voting

- Transition from off-chain to on-chain voting mechanisms
- Implementation of smart contracts for governance proposals and voting
- Exploration of delegation
- Gradual increase in governance scope over:
  - Puffer LRT: Adjusting protocol parameters, fees, and limits
  - UniFi AVS: Managing fee structures and whitelisting new rollups
  - UniFi Rollup: Setting fee parameters and directing ecosystem rewards
- Introduction of more complex governance decision-making processes
- Launch of the UniFi Grants Program
  - Community-driven initiative to fund projects contributing to the UniFi ecosystem

## Phase 3: Protocol Ossification

- Transition towards a fully autonomous and self-sustaining governance model
- Ossify governance processes and smart contracts
