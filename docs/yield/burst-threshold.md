The Burst Threshold is Puffer's commitment to Ethereum's Ethos.

### Burst Threshold

Puffer is [committed to self-capping](https://x.com/puffer_finance/status/1697817894900711700?s=20) its validator marketshare to 22\% of Ethereum's validator set, which we refer to as the protocol's _Burst Threshold_. Instead of abruptly pausing staking and NoOp registration once the burst threshold is reached, Puffer introduces a mechanism to organically reduce staker demand as the protocol reaches the threshold.

As the protocol reaches 22\%, the number of mintable validator tickets will be reduced such that it can only sustain existing validators but not new ones.

This pledge is critical to ensure that the Puffer protocol never breaches the [dangerous consensus threshold of 33\%](https://x.com/dannyryan/status/1688644951230267392?s=46&t=bsdBaPIHlTHEWDDdVUJW4g), which threatens the stability of Ethereum. We firmly believe that the burst threshold must be included from day one rather than after the protocol is profitable.
