# Governance Calendar

## Overview

The Puffer Governance Calendar is your one-stop resource for staying updated on key dates and events in Puffer’s governance processes. From proposal submission deadlines to voting cycles, our calendar ensures that all participants — be it vlPUFFER holders, or proposal creators — remain informed and engaged.

This calendar is embedded directly below for your convenience, and it is also accessible via the [Gauges section](https://app.puffer.fi/gauges). You can choose to import the calendar by importing the following iCal link to any calendar application that you use.

## Key Events on the Governance Calendar

### Voting Epochs

The voting epoch is when vlPUFFER holders can cast their votes on governance proposals and incentive gauges. These are critical moments for shaping the Puffer ecosystem, as decisions on incentive gauges, funding allocations, protocol upgrades, and key initiatives are determined during these periods.

Voting epochs currently lasts for fourteen (14) days and are clearly marked on the calendar. They typically occur on a monthly basis.

### Rewards Epochs

Rewards epochs dictate the distribution of incentives based on the outcomes of governance voting. These rewards epochs typically follow each voting epoch, with some operational buffer period, ensuring that rewards allocations to liquidity pools, validators, or other protocol participants are executed transparently and efficiently. Users can expect reward distributions to align with the incentive gauges voting results during the preceding voting epoch.

Rewards epochs currently lasts for four (4) weeks and are clearly marked on the calendar. They typically occur right after the previous rewards epoch ends (and likewise, the preceding voting epoch as well), with some operational buffer period.

### Governance Announcements

Important updates, such as parameter adjustments, governance outcomes, and new initiatives, are noted on the calendar. These announcements ensure transparency and keep the community informed of all significant developments in the Puffer ecosystem.

## Outside the Governance Calendar

While the calendar is comprehensive, the following governance-related events occur on an ongoing basis and may not always align with specific calendar dates.

### Proposal Submission

Proposals can be submitted **at any time** via the [Puffer Governance Forum](https://governance.puffer.fi/). Once submitted, they will undergo the [discussion and review process](./governance-understanding-governance.md) before being included in the next voting epoch.

### Discussion Periods

Every submitted proposal undergoes a **minimum five-day discussion period**, during which community members provide feedback and suggest improvements. This period ensures that proposals are well-informed and refined before proceeding to a review. There is no definite start and end date for every proposal, given that proposals can be created at any point in time, hence a minimum time is imposed so that there is sufficient time for consideration.
