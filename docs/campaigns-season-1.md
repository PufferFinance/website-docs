# Season 1

Puffer’s Season 1 demonstrated our commitment to Ethereum’s decentralization and user empowerment. This inaugural campaign preceded our TGE, anchored by the Crunchy Carrot Quest, distributed rewards to bolster decentralization, enhance protocol collaboration, and onboard more participants to the Ethereum ecosystem through Puffer.

## Crunchy Carrot Quest

The Crunchy Carrot Quest was our flagship incentive campaign in Season 1. By distributing Puffer Points across a carefully curated set of protocol partners, we encouraged activity in key areas of Ethereum’s infrastructure while rewarding meaningful contributions to decentralization. Participants could earn points through activities like restaking via EigenLayer, liquidity provisioning and engaging with partner protocols.

We announced that 7.5% of $PUFFER tokens are to be allocated to the Crunchy Carrot Quest participants, available immediately to reward early Puffer supporters. 50% is available on day 1 and for larger depositors, the rest is vested over 6 months for equal opportunity for all of our community. For more information, refer to the [PUFFER tokenomics](governance-token.md) article.

Claims will end on Janaury 14, 2025. If you have not yet made your claims, please do so at the official [Puffer Claims](https://claims.puffer.fi/) page.

## Partner Collaboration

Season 1 worked with a diverse range of DeFi protocols, creating synergies that benefited the broader Ethereum network. Some highlights included:

- Boosting decentralization: By incentivizing staking outside of dominant pools, we successfully reduced stETH’s market dominance by 2.38%, strengthening Ethereum’s network resilience.
- Cross-protocol engagement: Participants earned rewards by providing liquidity, participating in governance, or integrating with partner protocols, driving the decentralization of Ethereum.

## Point Distribution Framework

Puffer Points were distributed dynamically across partner protocols based on their contributions to network decentralization and user activity. This structure ensured rewards aligned with ecosystem priorities while giving participants a diverse set of opportunities to earn with the Puffer ecosystem.

## Empowering Validators at Scale

Season 1 wasn’t just about distributing points; it was about redefining who could participate in Ethereum’s infrastructure. Puffer’s Validator Tickets initiative lowered bond requirements to just 2 ETH, enabling more individuals to become validators and dramatically expanding Ethereum’s decentralization. Over 9,000 validators joined our network through this campaign, marking a significant milestone in Ethereum’s history.
