### Burst Threshold
As part of Puffer's commitment to Ethereum's decentralization, the size of the Puffer Pool will be self-capped. This is called the Burst Threshold with a maximum capacity of 22%. If the Puffer Pool reaches 22% of the validator set, pufETH minting and node onboarding will freeze.

This commitment is critical to ensure that the Puffer Pool never breaches the dangerous consensus threshold of 33%, which threatens the stability of Ethereum. We firmly believe that the Burst Threshold must be included from day one rather than after the protocol is profitable.

### Burst Threshold

Puffer is committed to self-capping its validator marketshare to 22% of Ethereumâ€™s validator set, which we refer to as the burst threshold. Instead of abruptly pausing pufETH minting when the burst threshold is reached, Puffer introduces a mechanism to incentivize for pufETH minting to slow as the protocol reaches the threshold.

As the protocol reaches 22%, the percentage of smoothing commissions that goes to the PufferPool will decrease and go to the Treasury instead. This reshuffling of rewards will decrease the APR of new stakers which will organically reduce the demand to mint pufETH. At 22% capacity, 100% of the smoothing commissions will go to the treasury. With no demand to mint pufETH, there will be no new eth to onboard validators, and the smoothing commitments will also dry up.
