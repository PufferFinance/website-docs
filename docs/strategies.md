### Strategy selection ü§î
The Puffer protocol is a collection of strategy contracts that each commit to restaking to operate an immutable set of AVSs. However, irrespective of their individual configurations, all strategies fundamentally include Ethereum Proof of Stake (PoS) validating. 

When NoOps choose to operate within a given strategy, they actively participate in earning both staking and restaking rewards. The choices aren't limited, rather they span a range that matches the varying risk and reward preferences of NoOps. The strategies that operate more AVSs serve to earn more restaking rewards from the generated AVS fees but also increase the chances that they are penalized from violating an AVS's rules. For this reason, some NoOps will prefer the default **`{Non-Restaking}`** strategy that abstains from restaking and minimizes NoOp risk. The NoOps that seek higher rewards can opt-in to joining the **`{EigenDA}`** strategy or even broader combinations like **`{EigenDA, Bridge}`**. 

### Joining a strategy üëà
To hold strong to our alignment to Ethereum's ethos, it is **always permissionless** for NoOps to join a strategy and deploy an Ethereum validator. To join, NoOps pay a non-refundable [smoothing commitment](/protocol/smoothing-commitments), which represents a long-term commitment to run a validator in the strategy. In exchange, they are provisioned 32 ETH to deploy their validator to the strategy's [EigenPod](https://github.com/Layr-Labs/eigenlayer-contracts/blob/master/docs/core/EigenPodManager.md#eigenpodmanager) contract. The NoOp is now entitled to keep all of the staking rewards (consensus and execution) generated by their validator. The NoOps that joined restaking strategies will receive restaking commission after each [growth spurt](/protocol/growth-spurts).


### Restaking risks and mitigations üöß
The concept of restaking, while promising, introduces certain inherent risks to stakers and NoOps alike. These primarily revolve around the vulnerabilities of smart contracts and potential AVS slashing risks. Yet, it's hard to ignore the immense value restaking brings to Ethereum's ecosystem. Through the sustainable rewards that it can offer, restaking can reshape the dynamics of the liquid staking market, which is currently on a dangerous path towards complete centralization.

Puffer strives to mitigate these risks by taking a conservative approach as restaking matures.

**Selecting NoOps for restaking**

To ensure a safe transition into the world of restaking, Puffer will rely more heavily on governance to decide restaking qualifications during its nascent stages. During this time, only the reputable NoOps with excellent performance that have been selected through governance will be eligible to operate the AVSs on behalf of a given strategy. 

As Eigenlayer, AVSs, and Puffer‚Äôs anti-slashing mechanisms mature, proven NoOps will have the option to operate AVSs without approval from governance.

**Allocating ETH to strategies**

The protocol will receive ETH from staker deposits, smoothing commitments, and restaking rewards.  An essential duty of the PufferProtocol contract is to allocate this ETH to various strategies based on their risk-reward profiles, potential returns, and the evolving landscape of the Eigenlayer restaking ecosystem.

Puffer employs a weighted round-robin allocation schedule, determined by governance, that rotates validator assignments to strategies based on predetermined weights. For instance, a schedule like `["Non-Restaking", "Non-Restaking", "Non-Restaking", "EigenDA"]` would indicate that for every four validators funded, three would go to the "Non-Restaking" strategy and one to the "EigenDA" strategy. The schedule should be chosen to prioritize the "Non-Restaking" strategy and low-risk restaking strategies.


### Strategy participants üôã‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
Each restaking strategy will contain validator-only NoOps and restaking NoOp[s]. While the former solely focuses on Ethereum PoS validation, the latter operates the AVSs on behalf of the strategy by restaking the other NoOps' ETH, earning commission. Given the elevated risk, validator-only NoOps are compensated through restaking commissions. This allows NoOps to earn more than they could in traditional liquid staking protocols. Risk-averse NoOps can choose the default Puffer strategy which will not engage in restaking.
