### Strategy selection ‚ôüÔ∏è
At Puffer's core are different strategy contracts. Each is committed to an immutable set of restaking applications, but by default all strategies include Ethereum Proof of Stake validating. When strategies are operated, they produce staking and restaking rewards. 

NoOps are expected to deploy their validators to the strategies that align with their risk and reward preferences, such as **`{Ethereum PoS}, {Ethereum PoS, EigenDA}, {Ethereum PoS, EigenDA, ...}`**. It is permissionless to join strategies but the NoOp is required to pay a non-refundable [smoothing commitment](/protocol/smoothing-commitments) upon entering. In exchange, they are provisioned a 32 ETH validator, entitled to 100% of the staking rewards it generates, and earn commission on the restaking rewards generated by the strategy.


### Restaking risks and mitigations üöß
Restaking increases staker and NoOp risk in the form of smart contract and slashing risk. However, it offers value to Ethereum's ecosystem and outsized rewards to stakers that can reshuffle the liquid staking market, which is on a dangerous path towards complete centralization. Puffer strives to mitigate this risk by taking a conservative approach as restaking matures. 

NoOps that meet the prerequisites are eligible to operate the restaking services on behalf of the strategy. During Puffer's initial phase, governance will be used to select the NoOps that can operate restaking services. As Eigenlayer, AVSs, and Puffer‚Äôs anti-slashing mechanisms mature, reputable NoOps will have the option to operate restaking services without approval from governance.

As a result, each restaking strategy will contain validator-only NoOps and restaking NoOp[s] that operate the restaking services on behalf of the strategy. To compensate for the increased risk, the validator-only NoOps are awarded restaking commissions to incentivize participating in the strategy. This allows NoOps to earn more than they could in traditional liquid staking protocols. Risk-averse NoOps can choose the default Puffer strategy which will not engage in restaking.
