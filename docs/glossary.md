### Glossary
### `Eigenlayer`
An Ethereum-based protocol that enables restaking

### `AVS`
Actively Validated Service ~ the term for a service on Eigenlayer

### `Restaking`
Where people reuse collateral to operate ≥ 1 AVS. If this collateral is beacon chain ETH, they are a called a `native restaker`

### `LSP`
Liquid Staking Protocol

### `pufETH`
The yield bearing token that represents staked ETH in Puffer’s LSP

### `Stakers`
The users who “stake” ETH to the pool to receive pufETH

### `NoOps`
The Puffer nodes that operate an Ethereum validator (and optionally additional AVSs)

### `Guardians`
A committee of Ethereum aligned community members and organizations to assist the protocol as it matures

### `Enclave`
A secure-computing environment capable of running Puffer’s anti-slashing technology

### `Burst Threshold`
Code in our smart contracts that self-caps the pool at 22% marketshare

### `Puffer DAO (pDAO)`
Governance for the protocol controlled by the `PUFI` governance token

### `VEM`
Voluntary Exit Message ~ a validator-signed message that will exit the signer when broadcasted to the beacon chain

### `Withdrawal Credentials`
A validator parameter that sets where their consensus rewards and full withdrawal eth are sent. For 0x01 (post-Shapella) withdrawals, the credentials are formatted as `0x01000000000000` ++ `20 byte ethereum address`

### `Consensus Rewards`
AKA partial withdrawals or skimmed rewards. These rewards are generated by Ethereum validators performing their PoS duties

### `Full Withdrawal`
The validator’s entire balance that is withdrawn from the beacon chain to the Ethereum address set by the withdrawal credentials

### `Smoothing Commitment`
The required eth that the NoOp must pay the pool upfront to receive 100% of staking rewards for the predefined duration
