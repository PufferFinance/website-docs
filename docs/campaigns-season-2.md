# Season 2

Welcome to Puffer Season 2 — a transformative step in our mission to decentralize Ethereum’s infrastructure while rewarding the Puffer community for the active participation in the ecosystem. This campaign introduces tokenized, on-chain incentives, enabling a seamless transition from off-chain calculations to an on-chain rewards system, directed by the community.

Season 2 represents a major evolution in our reward distribution mechanism, with CARROT as the official ERC-20 token for our tokenized Puffer Points. These tokens not only offer utility but also align incentives with our long-term vision.

## Key Features of Season 2

### On-Chain Incentives with CARROT

Season 2 transitions Puffer Points to on-chain incentives, leveraging CARROT as the token that powers our ecosystem. CARROT tokens are distributed weekly to protocol participants based on vePUFFER votes. The token is designed to enhance transparency, fairness, and efficiency in rewards allocation.

### Empowering Decentralized Governance

Season 2 enables $PUFFER holders to lock their tokens to receive vePUFFER, granting voting power in the governance process. vePUFFER holders decide how CARROT incentives are allocated, creating a community-driven ecosystem that reflects the collective will of the community.

### Permissionless Proposals

Protocol projects, liquidity providers, and contributors can now submit proposals to participate in Puffer’s incentive campaigns. With incentive gauges, projects can compete for CARROT allocations, further decentralizing and diversifying Puffer’s ecosystem.

## Stay tuned!

More information will follow soon.
