# Multisig Governance 
The Puffer contracts implement a timelock such that full contract upgrades and certain function calls cannot be executed without first waiting a one week to pass through the timelock. See [BlockSec's article](https://blocksec.com/blog/demystify-the-access-control-mechanism-in-puffer-protocol) on Puffer's access control mechanism for more details. There are three multisig accounts to be aware of: 

### The Pauser Multisig
Puffer's Pauser Multisig is a 1-of-9 multisig designed to pause the Puffer contracts in case of emergencies. The pauser will include active monitoring systems to promptly pause the contracts should an invariant be broken (or is about to be). 

### Operations Multisig
Puffer's Operations Multisig is a 3-of-5 multisig operated by the team. The timelock enforces that important function calls and upgrades must go through a 7-day delay before being executed. Actions initiated by the operations multisig can be vetoed by the community multisig during this window.

### Community Multisig
Puffer's Community Multisig is a 3-of-5 multisig composed of reputable and aligned Ethereum community members. The community multisig can bypass the timelock delay and has veto rights over actions initiated by the operations mulitsig. The multisig members are responsible for checking the actions of the operations multisig to ensure the protocol safely evolves over time.
