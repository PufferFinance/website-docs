Puffer aims to make Ethereum validating not just accessible but profitable 💪🐡

:::

The protocol strives to improve Ethereum validator diversity. Success means cementing a pocket of decentralization within the wider validator set up to our [burst threshold](/protocol/burst-threshold). In this spirit, the Puffer Protocol was designed to be...

### Safety first
> *The protocol must reduce staking and restaking risk for its stakers.*

- Puffer requires its NoOps to run anti-slashing hardware to mitigate slashing risk. Learn more 👉 [Secure-Signer for slash protection](/technology/secure-signer).
- Puffer introduces a novel approach to validator collateral with better long-term NoOp incentives. Learn more 👉 [smoothing commitment incentives](/protocol/smoothing-commitments).
- Puffer uses a highly-aligned security counsel to reduce inactivity risk. Learn more 👉 [Guardian duties](/protocol/guardians#what-are-their-duties).
- Puffer places strict guardrails around AVSs as the restaking ecosystem matures. Learn more 👉 [risk mitigations for restaking strategies](/protocol/strategies#restaking-risks-and-mitigations-).
- Puffer prevents single points of failure by diversifying the protocol's ETH amongst different Eigenlayer AVSs. Learn more 👉 [allocating ETH to strategies](/protocol/strategies#strategy-selection-).

### Ethos-aligned
> *The protocol must be aligned with Ethereum's ethos.*

- Puffer is preemptively self-capping it's pool size to 22% to protect Ethereum's credible neutrality. Learn more 👉 [burst threshold to self-cap](/protocol/burst-threshold).
- Puffer is designed with a roadmap to complete decentralization. Learn more 👉 [decentralizing the Guardians](/protocol/guardians#roadmap-to-decentralization).
- Puffer helps increase Ethereum's Proof of Stake stability since NoOps have long-term commitments. Learn more 👉 [smoothing commitments](/protocol/smoothing-commitments#pros-and-cons).
- Puffer received an Ethereum Foundation grant for our anti-slashing technology. Learn more 👉 [Secure-Signer](https://blog.ethereum.org/2023/02/22/allocation-update-q4-22).

### Permissionless
> *The protocol must allow anyone to run a validator.*

- Puffer allows anyone with [enclave-compatible](/reference/glossary#Enclave) hardware and less than 2 ETH run an Ethereum validator. Learn more 👉 [NoOp Requirements](/nodes/requirements).
- Puffer only requires NoOps to bring ETH ~ no need to purchase a protocol-specific token join. Learn more 👉 [registering a validator](/protocol/overview#-registering-a-noop-validator).

### Low barriers
> *The protocol must be capital efficient to attract NoOps.*

- Puffer reduces the ETH amount needed to become an Ethereum validator to less than 2 ETH, inviting more participants. Learn more 👉 [smoothing commitments](/protocol/smoothing-commitments).
- Puffer gives NoOps restaking exposure with less than 32 ETH. Learn more 👉 [strategies](/protocol/strategies#strategy-participants-).

### Profitable 
> *The protocol must be profitable to attract NoOps.*

- Puffer allows NoOps to increase their profit margins through Eigenlayer restaking exposure. Learn more 👉 [strategies](/protocol/strategies).
- Puffer NoOps use [enclave-compatible](/reference/glossary#Enclave) hardware to protect themselves from slashing while unlocking unique restaking opportunities, increasing their hardware efficiency. Learn more 👉 [Secure-Signer](/technology/secure-signer).

### Scalable
> *The protocol must be scalable to compete with centralized liquid staking protocols.*

- Puffer helps the protocol grow by allowing stakers to bring any amount of ETH. Learn more 👉 [minting pufETH](/stakers/minting-pufETH).
- Puffer supercharges rewards for pufETH holders through restaking exposure. Learn more 👉 [rewards](/protocol/rewards).
- Puffer is designed so that pufETH can grow in value even if validator queues are very long. Learn more 👉 [smoothing commitments](/protocol/smoothing-commitments#pros-and-cons).
