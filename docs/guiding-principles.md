Puffer aims to make Ethereum validating not just accessible but profitable 💪🐡

### Guiding Principles 🎯
The protocol strives to increase the profitability of at-home nodes operating as Ethereum validators and web3 infrastructure providers via Eigenlayer. Success means cementing a pocket of decentralization within the wider validator set up to our [burst threshold](/protocol/burst-threshold). In this spirit we follow three core guiding principles:

### Increase capital efficiency 💯
By reducing the amount of ETH required to be a NoOp, Puffer allows for far greater participation and diversity than the status quo for Ethereum validating and restaking. However, [care must be taken](/reference/slashing-in-PoS) to protect both NoOps and stakers. Puffer's [Secure-Signer](/technology/secure-signer) and [Guardians](/protocol/guardians) allow smoothing commitments to be reduced below 2 ETH by mitigating the risk of slashing and inactivity penalties.

### Increase economic opportunities 🤑
To truly incentivize people to run nodes from home, increasing NoOp profit margins is essential. Decentralized liquid staking protocols that fail to do so will need help attracting NoOps, as they are often economically better off staking their ETH on centralized platforms at the expense of Ethereum's security. In Puffer, NoOps can increase their profit margins through restaking exposure.

### Increase hardware efficiency ♻️
Validators must pay upfront hardware costs and ongoing electricity and internet costs that hurt their overall profitability. Additionally, due to the nature of Proof of Stake, validator hardware is under-utilized as the main duty of signing attestation messages is only required once per epoch (every 6.4 minutes). 

NoOps in Puffer utilize [enclave-compatible](/reference/glossary#Enclave) hardware that is comparable cost-wise to standard validator hardware but comes with many benefits. First, the NoOps protect themselves from committing slashable offenses, reducing their operating risk. Second, restaking is a way to increase hardware efficiency as a NoOp's latent compute power can be utilized to generate restaking rewards. Enclave-compatible hardware unlocks unique restaking services that can return better ROI on a NoOp's fixed hardware costs.
