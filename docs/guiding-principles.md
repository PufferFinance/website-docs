Puffer aims to make Ethereum validating not just accessible but profitable 💪🐡

:::

The protocol strives to improve Ethereum validator diversity. In this spirit, the Puffer Protocol was designed to be...

### Safety first
> *The protocol must reduce staking and restaking risk for its stakers and the networks they are supporting.*

- Puffer's NoOps run anti-slashing hardware and lock collateral to mitigate slashing risk. Learn more 👉 [Secure-Signer for slash protection](/technology/secure-signer).
- Puffer introduces a novel approach to validator collateral with better long-term NoOp incentives. Learn more 👉 [validator tickets incentives](/protocol/validator-tickets).
- Puffer uses a highly-aligned security counsel to reduce inactivity risk. Learn more 👉 [Guardian duties](/protocol/guardians#what-are-their-duties).
- Puffer places strict guardrails around which AVSs are allowed as the restaking ecosystem evolves. Learn more 👉 [restaking AVSs](/protocol/puffer-modules#restricting-avss).
- Puffer places strict guardrails around who can operate AVSs as the restaking ecosystem evolves. Learn more 👉 [restaking operators](/protocol/puffer-modules#restricting-reops).
- Puffer adjusts risk by allocating the protocol's ETH amongst different Eigenlayer AVSs and Restaking Operators. Learn more 👉 [allocating ETH to modules](/protocol/puffer-modules).

### Ethos-aligned
> *The protocol must be aligned with Ethereum's ethos.*

- Puffer is preemptively self-capping its protocol size to 22% to protect Ethereum's credible neutrality. Learn more 👉 [burst threshold to self-cap](/protocol/burst-threshold).
- Puffer is designed with a roadmap to complete decentralization. Learn more 👉 [decentralizing the Guardians](/protocol/guardians#roadmap-to-decentralization).
- Puffer helps increase Ethereum's Proof of Stake stability since NoOps have long-term commitments. Learn more 👉 [validator tickets](/protocol/validator-tickets#pros-and-cons).
- Puffer received an Ethereum Foundation grant for our anti-slashing technology. Learn more 👉 [Secure-Signer](https://blog.ethereum.org/2023/02/22/allocation-update-q4-22).

### Permissionless
> *The protocol must allow anyone to run a validator.*

- Puffer allows anyone with [enclave-compatible](/reference/glossary#enclave) hardware and 1 ETH to run an Ethereum validator. Learn more 👉 [NoOp Requirements](/reference/faq#%EF%B8%8F-how-much-eth-do-i-need-to-run-a-puffer-node).
- Puffer allows anyone with a 2 ETH bond (any hardware) to run an Ethereum validator. Learn more 👉 [NoOp Requirements](/reference/faq#%EF%B8%8F-how-much-eth-do-i-need-to-run-a-puffer-node).

### Low barriers
> *The protocol must be capital efficient to attract NoOps.*

- Puffer reduces the ETH amount needed to become an Ethereum validator to as little as 1 ETH, inviting more participants. Learn more 👉 [validator tickets](/protocol/validator-tickets).
- Puffer gives NoOps restaking exposure with less than 32 ETH. Learn more 👉 [modules](/protocol/puffer-modules).

### Profitable 
> *The protocol must be profitable to attract NoOps.*

- Puffer allows NoOps to increase their profit margins through Eigenlayer restaking exposure. Learn more 👉 [modules](/protocol/puffer-modules).
- Puffer NoOps use [enclave-compatible](/reference/glossary#enclave) hardware to protect themselves from slashing while unlocking unique restaking opportunities, increasing their hardware efficiency. Learn more 👉 [Secure-Signer](/technology/secure-signer).

### Scalable
> *The protocol must be scalable to compete with centralized liquid staking protocols.*

- Puffer helps the protocol grow by allowing stakers to bring any amount of ETH. Learn more 👉 [minting pufETH](/protocol/nlrt).
- Puffer supercharges rewards for pufETH holders through restaking exposure. Learn more 👉 [nLRTs](/protocol/nlrt).
- Puffer is designed so that pufETH can grow in value even if validator queues are very long. Learn more 👉 [validator tickets](/protocol/validator-tickets#pros-and-cons).
- Puffer stakers earn rewards even if the protocol's validators underperform. Learn more 👉 [NoOp incentives](/protocol/validator-tickets#why--noop-incentives).
