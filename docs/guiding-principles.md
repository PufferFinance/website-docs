Puffer aims to make Ethereum validating not just accessible but profitable 💪🐡

:::

The protocol strives to improve Ethereum validator diversity. Success means cementing a pocket of decentralization within the wider validator set up to our [burst threshold](/protocol/burst-threshold). In this spirit, the Puffer Protocol was designed to be...

### Safety first
> The protocol must reduce staking and restaking risk for its stakers.

- Puffer requires its NoOps to run anti-slashing hardware to mitigate slashing risk. Learn more about *Secure-Signer* 👉 [here](/technology/secure-signer).
- Puffer introduces a novel approach to validator collateral with better long-term NoOp incentives. Learn more about smoothing commitments 👉 [here](/protocol/smoothing-commitments).
- Puffer uses a highly-aligned security counsel to reduce inactivity risk. Learn more about *Guardians* 👉 [here](/protocol/guardians#what-are-their-duties).
- Puffer places strict guardrails around AVSs as the restaking ecosystem matures. Learn more about risk mitigations for restaking *strategies* 👉 [here](/protocol/strategies#restaking-risks-and-mitigations-).
- Puffer prevents single points of failure by diversifying the protocol's ETH amongst different Eigenlayer AVSs. Learn more about restaking *strategies* 👉 [here](/protocol/strategies#strategy-selection-).

### Ethos-aligned
> The protocol must be aligned with Ethereum's ethos.

- Puffer is preemptively self-capping it's pool size to 22% to protect Ethereum's credible neutrality. Learn more about our *burst threshold* 👉 [here](/protocol/burst-threshold).
- Puffer is designed with a roadmap to complete decentralization. Learn more about how we will decentralize the *Guardians* 👉 [here](/protocol/guardians#roadmap-to-decentralization).
- Puffer helps increase Ethereum's Proof of Stake stability since NoOps have long-term commitments. Learn more about smoothing commitments 👉 [here](/protocol/smoothing-commitments#pros-and-cons).

### Permissionless
> The protocol must allow anyone to run a validator.

- Puffer allows anyone with [enclave-compatible](/reference/glossary#Enclave) hardware and less than 2 ETH run an Ethereum validator. Learn more about *NoOp Requirements* 👉 [here](/nodes/requirements).
- Puffer only requires NoOps to bring ETH ~ no need to purchase a protocol-specific token join. Learn more about *registering a validator* 👉 [here](/protocol/overview#-registering-a-noop-validator).

### Low barriers
> The protocol must be capital efficient to attract NoOps.

- Puffer reduces the ETH amount needed to become an Ethereum validator to less than 2 ETH, inviting more participants. Learn more about smoothing commitments 👉 [here](/protocol/smoothing-commitments).
- Puffer gives NoOps restaking exposure with less than 32 ETH. Learn more about *strategies* 👉 [here](/protocol/smoothing-commitments).

### Profitable 
> The protocol must be profitable to attract NoOps.

- Puffer allows NoOps to increase their profit margins through Eigenlayer restaking exposure. Learn more about *strategies* 👉 [here](/protocol/strategies).
- Puffer NoOps use [enclave-compatible](/reference/glossary#Enclave) hardware to protect themselves from slashing while unlocking unique restaking opportunities, increasing their hardware efficiency. Learn more about *Secure-Signer* 👉 [here](/technology/secure-signer).

### Scalable
> The protocol must be scalable to compete with centralized liquid staking protocols.

- Puffer helps the protocol grow by allowing stakers to bring any amount of ETH. Learn more about *minting pufETH* 👉 [here](/stakers/minting-pufETH).
- Puffer supercharges rewards for pufETH holders through restaking exposure. Learn more about *rewards* 👉 [here](/protocol/rewards).
- Puffer is designed such that pufETH can grow in value even if validator queues are very long. Learn more about *smoothing commitments* 👉 [here](/protocol/smoothing-commitments#pros-and-cons).
