> Last Updated: November, 2023

This Cookie Policy explains how Puffer Foundation, a Cayman Islands foundation company (referred to herein as "_Puffer_", "_we_", "_our_", or "_us_") uses cookies and similar technologies in connection with our website located at [https://puffer.fi](https://puffer.fi) and any content, functionality, and services offered on or through such website ("Services"). This Cookie Policy should be read in conjunction with our [Privacy Policy](https://docs.puffer.fi/privacy-policy). If you have any questions or concerns about the Cookie Policy, please contact us at contact@puffer.fi or as otherwise described in our Privacy Policy.

### What are cookies and similar technologies?

- **Cookies** are text files that websites store and access on a visitor’s device to uniquely identify the visitor’s browser or to store information or settings in the browser to allow us distinguish you from other users of our Services for the purpose of helping you navigate between pages efficiently, remembering your preferences, enabling functionality, helping us understand activity and patterns, and facilitating online advertising.

- **Local storage technologies**, like HTML5, provide cookie-equivalent functionality but can store larger amounts of data, including on your device outside of your browser in connection with specific applications.

- **Web beacons**, also known as pixel tags or clear GIFs, are used to demonstrate that a webpage or email was accessed or opened, or that certain content was viewed or clicked.

This Cookie Policy refers to all these technologies, and other types of tracking technologies used through our Services, collectively as "cookies."

### What kind of cookies do we use?

Our website may use cookies to distinguish you from other users of out website. This may help us to provide you with a good experience when you browse our website and may also allow us to improve our website. By continuing to browse our website, you are agreeing to our use of cookies as well as the terms of this Cookie Policy. A cookie is a small file of letters and numbers that we may store on your browser or the hard drive of your computer if you agree. Cookies contain information that is transferred to your computer’s hard drive. We may use the following cookies:

- **Strictly necessary cookies**. These are cookies that are required for the operation of our website. They include, for example, cookies that enable you to log into secure areas of the Websites, use a shopping cart or make use of e-commerce payment processing services.

- **Analytical/performance cookies**. They allow us to recognize and count the number of visitors and to see how visitors move around our website when they are using it. This may help us to improve the way our website works, for example, by ensuring that users are finding what they are looking for easily.

- **Functionality cookies**. These cookies are used to recognize you when you return to our website. They may enable us to personalize our content for you, greet you by name, or remember your preferences (for example, your choice of language or region).

- **Targeting cookies**. These cookies record your visit to our website, the pages you have visited and the links you have followed.

Depending on your location, the maximum expiration period for the cookies above is 2 years.

We may also use web beacons in promotional emails and other communications with you, to allow us to count how many people read them and to verify any clicks through to links within an email. We (or our marketing service providers on our behalf) use this to help us understand how an email campaign performed, what types of emails and content our recipients find interesting, and what actions our recipients took, so we can improve our email campaigns in the future and make our emails more relevant to our recipients. If you do not wish for the web beacon to be downloaded onto your device, you should select to receive emails from us in plain text rather than HTML.

Where legally required, you will be presented with a cookie banner or other tool to provide permissions before we or our service providers set non-necessary cookies. In this case, we only set these non-necessary cookies with your consent. You may revoke your consent at any time with future effect by clicking on the cookie settings link in the bottom corner of the website at any time.

### Online tracking opt out

To do this, follow the instructions in your browser settings. Many browsers accept cookies by default until you change your settings.

- **Blocking advertising ID use in your mobile settings**. Your mobile device settings may provide functionality to limit use of the advertising ID associated with your mobile device for interest-based advertising purposes.

- **Using privacy plug-ins or browsers**. You can block our services from setting cookies by using a browser with privacy features, like Brave, or installing browser plugins like Privacy Badger, DuckDuckGo, Ghostery or uBlock Origin, and configuring them to block third party cookies/trackers.

- **Platform opt outs**. The following platforms offer opt out features that let you opt out of use of your information for interest-based advertising: Facebook, Google, LinkedIn, X.
