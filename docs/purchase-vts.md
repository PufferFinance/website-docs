Validator Tickets are ERC20 tokens that grant the holder the right to run a staker-funded Ethereum validator for a day. VTs are minted by ETH deposits. This ETH goes towards compensating pufETH holders for financing validators.

There are two ways to purchase VTs:

1. Through the "Purchase" step on [Puffer Launchpad](https://launchpad.puffer.fi/).
2. By directly calling the smart contract function.
