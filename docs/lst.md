pufETH is a reward-bearing token akin to Compound's cToken, which is optimal regarding DeFi compatibility. As the protocol generates rewards, the amount of ETH backing pufETH increases, increasing the conversion rate between the two. Holding liquid pufETH allows one to earn staking and restaking rewards over time while still being able to participate in DeFi.
