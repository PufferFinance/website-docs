Stakers are the individuals who stake their ETH at the Puffer Protocol to receive the pufETH liquid staking token. When the staker stakes â‰¥ 0.01 ETH it is added to a pool of ETH. Part of this pool is provisioned to nodes to meet the 32 ETH requirement to activate an Ethereum validator, and the rest provides exit liquidity for when stakers want to redeem ETH for their pufETH.
