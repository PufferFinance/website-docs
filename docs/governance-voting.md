Voting will occur on the [Puffer Governance Hub](https://vote.puffer.fi) and requires you to have staked vePUFFER. See the [vePUFFER](governance-token.md#what-is-vepuffer) section for more information.

## Minting vePUFFER
:::note
Instructions are subject to change.
:::
To mint vePUFFER, first claim your PUFFER tokens from the official [claims page](https://claims.puffer.fi).

Once you have claimed your tokens, you will need to approve the [vePUFFER contract](https://etherscan.io/address/0xA55eD5808aeCDF23AE3782C1443185f5D2363ce7) to spend your [PUFFER tokens](https://etherscan.io/address/0x4d1C297d39C5c1277964D0E3f8Aa901493664530). Your vePUFFER voting power will start proportional to the amount of PUFFER you stake and increase the longer you hold the NFT.

:::note
The minimum stake amount is 100 PUFFER as outlined in the [vePUFFER parameters](governance-token.md#vepuffer-parameters).

There is a three day warmup period after minting your vePUFFER tokens before you can start voting - see the [vePUFFER](governance-token.md#vepuffer-parameters) section for more details.

## How to Vote

Proposals are first created and discussed on the [Governance Forum](https://governance.puffer.fi) and then posted to the [Puffer DAO Hub](https://vote.puffer.fi) for voting.

1. Navigate to [vote.puffer.fi](https://vote.puffer.fi)
2. Connect your wallet
3. View proposals on the `Latest proposals` window or via the `Community` tab

4. Select the proposal to read more about it

5. Vote on proposals by clicking the `Vote` button

The proposal passes unless rejections outnumber approvals after the voting period has ended. Specifically, a proposal is approved if:
   - Approvals exceed or equal rejections
   - No votes are cast (effectively treated as equal approvals and vetoes)

:::note
Initially the votes will be cast using Snapshot voting. In our next phase we will transition to fully on-chain voting.
