# About UniFi Rollup

Puffer's UniFi is an Ethereum Layer 2 (L2) rollup solution designed to address the fragmentation of Ethereum, enhance value within the L1 network, and provide credibly neutral transaction sequencing, all while maintaining an intuitive user experience that supports mass adoption.

### What is a "Based Rollup"?

Based rollups derive their transaction sequencing directly from Ethereum validators on the L1 network. This means that L1 validators determine the order of rollup transactions within the blocks they propose. By shifting sequencing responsibilities to L1 validators, UniFi eliminates the need for a centralized sequencer, giving users access to Ethereum's decentralized validator set for a more secure and neutral transaction layer.

### Key Features of UniFi Rollup

- **Credibly Neutral Sequencing**: Transactions are sequenced by Ethereum's L1 validators, ensuring reliability and neutrality.
- **Fast Transactions**: Users enjoy 100ms pre-confirmations, enhancing the overall experience.
- **Value Flow Back to Ethereum**: Sequencing fees flow back to block proposers on Ethereum, supporting the sustainability and value of the L1 network.

### Why Choose UniFi Rollup?

UniFi aims to drive long-term sustainability and value into Ethereum's base layer by allowing transaction sequencing fees to benefit L1 validators. Users benefit from fast, seamless, and cost-efficient transactions, making it an ideal solution for those seeking scalability without sacrificing decentralization.
