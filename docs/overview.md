### Strategy selection ‚ôüÔ∏è
At Puffer's core are different strategy contracts. Each is committed to an immutable set of restaking applications, but by default all strategies include Ethereum Proof of Stake validating. When strategies are operated, they produce staking and restaking rewards. 

NoOps are expected to deploy their validators to the strategies that align with their risk and reward preferences, such as **`{Ethereum PoS}, {Ethereum PoS, EigenDA}, {Ethereum PoS, EigenDA, ...}`**. It is permissionless to join strategies but the NoOp is required to pay a non-refundable [smoothing commitment](/protocol/smoothing-commitments) upon entering. In exchange, they are provisioned a 32 ETH validator, entitled to 100% of the staking rewards it generates, and earn commission on the restaking rewards generated by the strategy.


### Restaking risks and mitigations üöß
Restaking increases staker and NoOp risk in the form of smart contract and slashing risk. However, it offers value to Ethereum's ecosystem and outsized rewards to stakers that can reshuffle the liquid staking market, which is on a dangerous path towards complete centralization. Puffer strives to mitigate this risk by taking a conservative approach as restaking matures. 

NoOps that meet the prerequisites are eligible to operate the restaking services on behalf of the strategy. During Puffer's initial phase, governance will be used to select the NoOps that can operate restaking services. As Eigenlayer, AVSs, and Puffer‚Äôs anti-slashing mechanisms mature, reputable NoOps will have the option to operate restaking services without approval from governance.

As a result, each restaking strategy will contain validator-only NoOps and restaking NoOp[s] that operate the restaking services on behalf of the strategy. To compensate for the increased risk, the validator-only NoOps are awarded restaking commissions to incentivize participating in the strategy. This allows NoOps to earn more than they could in traditional liquid staking protocols. Risk-averse NoOps can choose the default Puffer strategy which will not engage in restaking.

### 0Ô∏è‚É£ Creating Strategies 
The protocol will begin with a default strategy that only allows for PoS validating and cannot engage in restaking. This is considered the "risk-free" strategy for NoOps.

Puffer governance plays a crucial role in overseeing strategies, including adding new strategies and managing the flow of ETH from the stakers to different strategies. 

For example, adding a new strategy to the PufferProtocol contract requires a governance proposal that:
1. Vets and selects the AVSs that the strategy can use.
2. Vets and selects the NoOp[s] that will operate the AVSs.

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Staking ETH  
Stakers deposit ETH to mint pufETH at the PufferPool contract. This acts as a receipt that is redeemable for ETH from the WithdrawalPool contract if there is sufficient exit liquidity. The redeemable amount is expected to increase over time as NoOps pay smoothing commitments to join the protocol and generate restaking rewards by executing strategies. 

Compared to traditional LSTs, pufETH holders can earn more since pufETH captures restaking rewards in addition to validator rewards. Also, since smoothing commitments account for a year of staking rewards upfront, pufETH value is able to accrue much faster.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Registering a NoOp validator
NoOps pay a `1 ‚â§ S < 2 ETH`, non-refundable smoothing commitment to the PufferProtocol to register a new validator public key. NoOps are required to share their encrypted validator keyshares with the Guardians' enclaves to eject them if their balance falls below 1 ETH. This requirement is to protect Staker ETH and it will be replaced with a trustless solution once Ethereum's specs allow it via EIP-7002. 

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Provisioning ETH
Each PufferStrategy contract will contain a queue of pending validator registrations. As the PufferPool accrues 32 ETH chunks from deposits and rewards, the Guardians will provision the chunks to pending validators. They are required to follow a weighted round-robin schedule to service all of the PufferStrategy contracts. Governance is used to decide the schedule and it should be chosen to balance the pool's growth and restaking risk. After provisioning, the NoOp's validator has deposited to the BeaconDepositContract and awaits activation.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Staking rewards 
Once activated, the NoOp's validator will generate staking rewards that accrue in the strategy's EigenPod. These rewards will be withdrawable at the end of each [Growth Spurt](/protocol/growth-spurts). Since NoOp's receive 100% of the staking rewards they generate, they are incentivized to maximize their validators' performance. 

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Restaking rewards 
The strategies that engage in restaking will generate additional rewards through AVS fee revenue that supercharges rewards for pufETH holders and NoOps. After each growth spurt, the NoOps running validators within the strategy will be able to withdraw restaking commission to supplement their staking rewards.
