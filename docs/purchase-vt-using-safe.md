1. Navigate to the [Puffer Launchpad](https://launchpad.puffer.fi).

4. Other owners of the Safe will need to sign the transaction as well, according to your Safe's signature requirements. Once executed, you can view the transaction on the Puffer LaunchPad. And your VT will be added to your account.

## Purchasing VTs with pufETH

When using pufETH, you'll need to complete two separate transactions:

1. Navigate to the Validator Ticket purchase section on the LaunchPad. Select `Validator Ticket` option, select `pufETH` as the payment currency, enter the amount of VT you want to purchase and `Submit Transaction`.

2. The first transaction will ask for approval to spend your pufETH:

   - Review the approval amount and address of the spender contract which should be ValidatorTicket contract address : [0x7D26AD6F6BA9D6bA1de0218Ae5e20CD3a273a55A](https://etherscan.io/address/0x7D26AD6F6BA9D6bA1de0218Ae5e20CD3a273a55A)
   - Click "Add to Batch" to add the transaction to the batch.

3. After the approval transaction is added to the batch, a second transaction will appear:

   - This transaction is for the actual VT purchase
   - Verify the number of VTs you're purchasing
   - Click "Add to Batch" to add the transaction to the batch.
   - Wait for other Safe owners to sign

4. Once batch is signed, get it signed by other owners of the Safe and execute the batch.

5. After successful execution, you'll see the transaction on the Puffer LaunchPad. And your VT will be added to your account.

## Transaction Batching (Optional)

With Safe, you have the option to:

- Execute transactions individually as they are signed
- Or batch multiple signed transactions together and execute them in a single transaction to save on gas fees
- In this guide, we've shown how to batch the transactions together.

## Important Notes

- Ensure you have sufficient ETH or pufETH balance in your Safe wallet before initiating these transactions.
- The minimum purchase is 1 VT.
- You can track all your transactions in the "Activity" section of your Safe.
- If you encounter any issues, please contact Puffer team.
