# Contract Addresses and Docs
## Puffer Protocol Contracts
Puffer's smart contracts are located in two repos:
### [PufferFinance/pufETH](https://github.com/PufferFinance/pufETH)
> This repo contains the `PufferVault` contract which is where the protocol's assets (ETH, wETH, stETH) are held and the `pufETH` LRT is minted.

> Visit the [technical documentation](https://github.com/PufferFinance/pufETH/tree/main/docs) for more information.

### [PufferFinance/PufferPool](https://github.com/PufferFinance/PufferPool)
> This repo contains the core contracts for Puffer's protocol. The core functionality is to:
- allow for users to permissionlessly run Ethereum validators
- interface with EigenLayer's contracts to enable native restaking and delegation

> Visit the [technical documentation](https://github.com/PufferFinance/PufferPool/tree/master/docs) for more information.

## Deployment Addresses
