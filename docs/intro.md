:::info About Puffer
Puffer is the first native liquid restaking protocol built on Eigenlayer 🐡🤝🟣
:::

It makes native restaking on [Eigenlayer](https://www.eigenlayer.xyz/) more accessible, allowing anyone to run an Ethereum Proof of Stake validator while supercharging their rewards.

The protocol is driven by **Stakers** and **Node Operators** (NoOps):
- **NoOps** pay the protocol [smoothing commitments](protocol/smoothing-commitments) worth less than 2 ETH and in exchange get to run 32 ETH validators and keep 100% of the staking rewards they generate. The NoOps that engage in [restaking](reference/glossary#Restaking) will earn additional restaking rewards commissions from the [AVSs](reference/glossary#AVS) they operate.
- **Stakers** deposit ETH to fund the protocol's 32 ETH validators in exchange for the pufETH [Liquid Staking Token](protocol/liquid-staking-token). The amount of ETH that pufETH can be redeemed for will increase as the protocol receives smoothing commitments and restaking rewards from NoOps.


### Why be a NoOp? 🤖
Puffer allows anyone with less than 2 ETH to run their own validator to earn sustainable Proof of Stake rewards while helping to decentralize the network. Since they are entitled to 100% of their validators' execution rewards, NoOps get to decide their MEV strategy [which can be very lucrative in some cases](https://etherscan.io/block/17806773#mevinfo). They also receive 100% of their validators' consensus rewards, meaning their profitability depends solely on their own performance, creating long-term incentives for honest NoOp behavior. Finally, Puffer's capital efficiency extends to restaking. NoOps can get restaking exposure for additional rewards without requiring the 32 ETH to become a native restaker.

### Why stake? 🥩
Instead of waiting a year for staking rewards to accrue, pufETH holders receive a year’s worth of staking rewards each time a NoOp pays a smoothing commitment to deploy a new validator. This favors early stakers as pufETH benefits from all future smoothing commitments and restaking rewards. To ensure staked ETH is safe, the protocol requires NoOps to run Puffer’s [anti-slashing technology](technology/secure-signer), will eject validators whose balance falls too low, and has restaking guardrails.

### The Puffer Flywheel 🎡

</div>

Together, Stakers and NoOps create a flywheel effect that allows the protocol to outpace the growth of traditional liquid staking protocols. However, to ensure that Puffer never becomes a threat to Ethereum's credible neutrality, the [burst threshold](protocol/burst-threshold) caps the protocol at 22% of the validator set. 

## What does Puffer bring? 🍽️

- 🥩 Native Restaking: the first native liquid restaking protocol on Eigenlayer.

- 🧢 Ethos Alignment: the protocol is self-capped to protect Ethereum.

- 🐡 Explosive Growth: pufETH can grow in value even if validator queues are long.

### **NoOps**

- 💯 Capital Efficiency: less than 2 ETH to run a validator.

- 🐢 Slash Protection: first-of-its-kind anti-slashing hardware support.

- 🎲 MEV Autonomy: NoOps choose their MEV strategy.


### **Rewards**

- 💦 Liquid Staking: anyone can stake any ETH amount.

- 🚀 Restaking Rewards: Eigenlayer integration supercharges rewards.

- 🧈 Smoothing Commitments: aligns NoOp incentives and smooths MEV.
