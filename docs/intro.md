# Puffer Introduction

Puffer is an anti-slashing and permissionless liquid staking protocol that facilitates at-home staking via a low bond requirement of as little as 2 ETH. The Puffer team presents [Secure-Signer](tech/securesigner.md), a remote-signing tool compatible with all consensus clients that prevents slashable offenses through trusted hardware. Utilizing Secure-Signer within the Puffer Pool eliminates the risk of slashing, either by accident
or due to bugs in the consensus client.

## Mission
> Increase the viability of at-home validators 

The Ethereum staking industry is in a race to the bottom, and the low-margin business of operating nodes is most easily filled by institutions, leading to centralization ([more on risks of LSTs](https://notes.ethereum.org/@djrtwo/risks-of-lsd)). Considering the high hardware costs and associated operating risks, becoming an at-home staker is not economically viable. However, it is essential for the validator set to be composed of diverse nodes to ensure censorship resistance and credible neutrality, the properties that make Ethereum valuable. Puffer aims to address this issue by mitigating the risks tied to Proof-of-Stake (PoS) operations, lowering the bond requirement, and offering additional reward opportunities by better utilizing hardware via unique restaking services.
